The knowledge graph (KG) and ontology enable reasoning to enhance dialogue response generation. The task involves integrating a GraphRAG-like approach to query the knowledge base and generate accurate, context-aware responses.\n\nSpecifically, the notebook has the following steps:\n\n1. **Setup**: Loading the knowledge graph, dialogues, and required libraries (e.g., OWLAPY).\n2. **Analyzing the knowledge graph**: Exploring its structure and entities using OWLAPY queries.\n3. **Extending the ontology**: Adding TBox information for expressive reasoning.\n4. **Creating dialogues**: Create dialogues based on the examples. Write 5 simple dialogues and 5 more detailed ones to showcase different types of interactions.\n5. **Combining ontology and KG data**: Deploying an OWL reasoner to perform class-expression queries.\n6. **Query generation with LLMs**: Using an LLM (e.g., Llama3.2) to generate or assist in creating queries against the KG.\n7. **Generating responses**: Summarizing retrieved data into dialogue responses using a KG-augmented RAG approach.\n8. **Evaluation**: Assessing the system's performance using metrics like intersection-over-union scores.\n\n## Assignment\nThe goal of this assignment is to develop a logic-enhanced conversational system that retrieves and reasons over domain knowledge to assist in dialogue response generation. You will focus on both the technical aspects of KG+ontology reasoning and the integration with LLMs for robust responses.\n\n### Assignment Steps\n1. **Analyze the provided knowledge graph and dialogues**:\n   - Explore the KG's entities, properties, and relevance to the dialogues.\n   - Identify opportunities where ontology reasoning enhances dialogue responses.\n2. **Extend the ontology**:\n   - Add expressive TBox information to support meaningful inferences.\n3. **Deploy the reasoning environment**:\n   - Use OWLAPY to combine the KG (as ABox) with the ontology for reasoning-based queries.\n4. **Generate class-expression queries**:\n   - Use instruction-based, few-shot prompting with Llama3.2 to produce or assist in creating the queries.\n5. **Summarize results into dialogue responses**:\n   - Apply KG-augmented RAG to generate user-facing answers based on reasoning results.\n6. **Evaluate the system**:\n   - Use appropriate metrics, including intersection-over-union scores for set-based answers.\n\n## Report\nWrite a **5-page report** in LNCS format that includes:\n\n1. **Introduction**: Background on conversational systems with LLMs and the role of reasoning over domain knowledge.\n2. **Methodology**: A detailed description of your approach, including diagrams and examples.\n3. **Results**: Evaluation findings from the implemented steps.\n4. **Discussion**: Strengths and weaknesses of your approach, lessons learned, and potential improvements.\n\nMake sure to use the following template: [Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj)\n\n\n## Grading\nYour work will be evaluated based on:\n\n1. **Code Implementation (30%)**: Quality and functionality of the logic-enhanced conversational system.\n2. **Report (70%)**: Depth of analysis and clarity in presenting methods, results, and lessons learned.\n\n## Kaggle Environment Notes\nTo ensure smooth execution:\n- Load the required data into `/kaggle/input/`.\n- Use `/kaggle/working/` for saving temporary files.\n- Turn on GPUs and internet connectivity when necessary, and follow best practices for resource management.","metadata":{"id":"MfQioNKroT0c"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input director\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\"\n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","id":"TV-bH-nEoT0h","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-01-12T13:29:55.499407Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-01-12T13:29:55.500389Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-01-12T13:29:55.856801Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-01-12T13:29:55.500349Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-01-12T13:29:55.855733Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"/kaggle/input/rdf-ontology/data.rdf\n/kaggle/input/ontology-data/data.ttl\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Install packages","metadata":{"id":"lj0oLsVcoT0j"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install jpype1==1.5.2\n!pip install owlapy==1.5.1 \n!pip install ollama","metadata":{"id":"TzM11Swgj6lu","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import libraries\n","metadata":{"id":"ld9x785-oT0j"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from owlapy import manchester_to_owl_expression, dl_to_owl_expression\nfrom owlapy.iri import IRI\nfrom owlapy.owl_ontology import Ontology\nfrom owlapy.owl_reasoner import SyncReasoner, StructuralReasoner","metadata":{"id":"MSCgz1kEoT0j","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
