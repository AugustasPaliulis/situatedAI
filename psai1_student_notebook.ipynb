The knowledge graph (KG) and ontology enable reasoning to enhance dialogue response generation. The task involves integrating a GraphRAG-like approach to query the knowledge base and generate accurate, context-aware responses.\n\nSpecifically, the notebook has the following steps:\n\n1. **Setup**: Loading the knowledge graph, dialogues, and required libraries (e.g., OWLAPY).\n2. **Analyzing the knowledge graph**: Exploring its structure and entities using OWLAPY queries.\n3. **Extending the ontology**: Adding TBox information for expressive reasoning.\n4. **Creating dialogues**: Create dialogues based on the examples. Write 5 simple dialogues and 5 more detailed ones to showcase different types of interactions.\n5. **Combining ontology and KG data**: Deploying an OWL reasoner to perform class-expression queries.\n6. **Query generation with LLMs**: Using an LLM (e.g., Llama3.2) to generate or assist in creating queries against the KG.\n7. **Generating responses**: Summarizing retrieved data into dialogue responses using a KG-augmented RAG approach.\n8. **Evaluation**: Assessing the system's performance using metrics like intersection-over-union scores.\n\n## Assignment\nThe goal of this assignment is to develop a logic-enhanced conversational system that retrieves and reasons over domain knowledge to assist in dialogue response generation. You will focus on both the technical aspects of KG+ontology reasoning and the integration with LLMs for robust responses.\n\n### Assignment Steps\n1. **Analyze the provided knowledge graph and dialogues**:\n   - Explore the KG's entities, properties, and relevance to the dialogues.\n   - Identify opportunities where ontology reasoning enhances dialogue responses.\n2. **Extend the ontology**:\n   - Add expressive TBox information to support meaningful inferences.\n3. **Deploy the reasoning environment**:\n   - Use OWLAPY to combine the KG (as ABox) with the ontology for reasoning-based queries.\n4. **Generate class-expression queries**:\n   - Use instruction-based, few-shot prompting with Llama3.2 to produce or assist in creating the queries.\n5. **Summarize results into dialogue responses**:\n   - Apply KG-augmented RAG to generate user-facing answers based on reasoning results.\n6. **Evaluate the system**:\n   - Use appropriate metrics, including intersection-over-union scores for set-based answers.\n\n## Report\nWrite a **5-page report** in LNCS format that includes:\n\n1. **Introduction**: Background on conversational systems with LLMs and the role of reasoning over domain knowledge.\n2. **Methodology**: A detailed description of your approach, including diagrams and examples.\n3. **Results**: Evaluation findings from the implemented steps.\n4. **Discussion**: Strengths and weaknesses of your approach, lessons learned, and potential improvements.\n\nMake sure to use the following template: [Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj)\n\n\n## Grading\nYour work will be evaluated based on:\n\n1. **Code Implementation (30%)**: Quality and functionality of the logic-enhanced conversational system.\n2. **Report (70%)**: Depth of analysis and clarity in presenting methods, results, and lessons learned.\n\n## Kaggle Environment Notes\nTo ensure smooth execution:\n- Load the required data into `/kaggle/input/`.\n- Use `/kaggle/working/` for saving temporary files.\n- Turn on GPUs and internet connectivity when necessary, and follow best practices for resource management.","metadata":{"id":"MfQioNKroT0c"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It
